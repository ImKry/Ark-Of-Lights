Ark of Lights is a Terraria mod that Adds Items, Buffs, NPCs, and Mechanics.

OpenSource in https://github.com/rafaelkamv/Ark-Of-Lights


New Mechanics that Ark of Ligths add are Alchemy/Chemistry system,
adding alot of Progression and Sub-items to play with.

Allowing longer but easier progression, and this extends to Hardmode.
Because this mods adds Complex crafting recipes, but not in the way you think.
Complex in this mod just requiers alot of Items from Previous tier, And this always applies to higher up Tier of Recipes.

Added a few(Working on it) NPCs into the game.
One of them is Albedo which is from Genshin Impact.
He'll move in at Mid-Late Hardmode and he will sells you potions that are available at that point of progression.
